# 🧠 AESTHETICA AI Feasibility Summary

## ✅ Overall Outlook
- **Success Probability:** **6.5/10** (Moderate)
- **On-Time Delivery Confidence:** Cautious; risks from external integrations
- **Feasibility Score:** **7/10** — technically viable, but requires meticulous execution

---

## 🔌 Key Findings
- **Core Requirement:** Seamless integration with **Canva**, **Adobe**, and **Google Workspace**
- **Primary Risks:**
  - API rate limits, outages, and poor documentation
  - OAuth setup complexity
  - High integration load for a solo developer

## 📊 Platform-Specific Integration Summary

| Platform             | Complexity | Risk        | Notes                                      |
|----------------------|------------|-------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Canva**            | Medium     | 🔶 Moderate | Best starting point; strong Zapier support |
| **Google Workspace** | High       | 🔶 High     | OAuth issues and admin restrictions common |
| **Adobe**            | Very High  | 🔴 Critical | Expensive, poorly documented, high error risk |

---

## 📈 Estimated Completion Probability (within 8 weeks)

- **Canva + Google Workspace:** 85% (via Zapier + GitHub Actions)
- **Including Adobe:** Drops to 55% due to API complexity

## ⚠️ Top Risk Areas

| Risk                            | Mitigation Strategy                  |
|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| API outages (e.g. Canva)         | Add fallback workflows & retries     |
| OAuth errors (e.g. Google, Adobe)| Early setup + test auth flows        |
| Adobe complexity                 | Postpone until MVP is stable         |
| Formatting/API instability       | Use scripts for post-processing      |

---

## 🧪 Testing Recommendations
- **End-to-End Tests**: Validate agent workflows through external APIs  
- **A/B Testing**: Compare AESTHETICA outputs to Canva native tools  
- **User Feedback Loops**: Collect input on creative quality & usability  

---

## 🚀 MVP Strategy Recommendation
- **Phase 1:** Integrate **Canva + Google Workspace** using Zapier and GitHub Actions  
- **Phase 2:** Gradually introduce Adobe APIs after MVP success  
- **Architecture:** Serverless-lite (Zapier triggers, GitHub CI, Google Drive outputs)
